text: Welcome to Devinium, we started out in a game called RIFT back in December 2013 and since then we have been raiding off and on again. Now we are back again and this time we have our eyes set on the good old Classic era of World of Warcraft released at the end of 2024.

We are looking for good raiders that want to progress. Socials are however more than welcome even though we are going to keep the overall guild roster as small as possible.

Our raid times are Wednesday, and Thursday 20-23 Server Time.
